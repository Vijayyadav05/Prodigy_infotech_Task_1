# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing population data using Python. The goal is to extract insights, visualize trends, and compare the total population of countries over time.

# Key Features
### Data Import and Setup

1.Imported necessary Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
Loaded the dataset (Total Pop.csv) into a DataFrame for analysis.
Population Analysis

2.Extracted the top 10 countries with the largest population difference between 1990 and 2023.
Extracted the bottom 10 countries with respect to total population.
Data Visualization

3.Used visualizations like bar charts or line graphs to showcase population trends across countries and time periods.
Handling Data

4.Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, if any.
Used appropriate Python functions to perform calculations and comparisons.

# Tools and Technologies
Python

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical calculations

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

# Insights and Outcomes
### Top Population Changes

Identified the countries with the most significant changes in population over time.
Lowest Population Countries

Analyzed the countries with the smallest population figures and trends.
Visual Trends

Provided clear visualizations to identify and compare population changes for better understanding.
